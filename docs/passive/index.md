# Passive modus

In the passive mode, a broadcast model is followed. 2300 acts as a sender, while 2200 listens to the various messages.

## Message layer

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Middleware | [ZMQ sockets](<https://zeromq.org>) version 4.x |
| ZMQ message pattern | Publish-subscribe. 2200 using SUB socket and 2300 PUB socket |
| Publish binding argument | `tcp://*:4204` i.e., uses underlying TCP socket connect to port 4204. |
| Subscriber connect argument | `tcp://<host address>:4204`. The `<host address>` contains the IP address of 2300. |

The message used are described in the [messages spec](../messages.md). Only the base messages are used. Since messages
will only be broadcasted, the messages will be limited to only the [base request](../messages.md#base-request).

## Application layer

The application layer contains the specific application functions that are described in the
[root document](../index.md). The functions are described via the contents of the published dictionaries.

### Meta communication

System information from 2300 is divided over both active and passive communication. The messages below are published by
2300.

#### Publish status

System 2300 publishes a status message to inform subscribers of its current status. This happens both via a heartbeat
("am I still responsive") and the state the system is in.

The schema for validation can be found in:

* [`/schemas/publish_status/request.schema.json`](../../schemas/publish_status/message.schema.json)

##### Publish status payload

| Key | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | `str` | The current status of the system in all-capitals (i.e. IDLE, EXECUTING, CALIBRATING, OFFLINE) |
| `timestamp` | `float` | Timestamp of the instantiation of the message (return value of `time.time()`) |

##### Publish status example

```jsonc
{
    "command": "publish_status",
    "payload": {
        "status": "IDLE",
        "timestamp": 1690061619.610174
    },
    "version": "0.1.0"
}
```

#### Publish dynamic

Dynamic information is generated by 2300. This information can for example constitute calibration data like T1 and T2*.
This dynamic metadata is shared with the rest of the system via a broadcasting message.

The schema for validation can be found in:

* [`/schemas/publish_dynamic/request.schema.json`](../../schemas/publish_dynamic/message.schema.json)

##### Publish dynamic payload

The payload for the message is still under advicement. The appropriate key-value pairs will be filled in when they are
determined.

| Key | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| - | - | - |

##### Publish dynamic example

```jsonc
{
    "command": "publish_dynamic",
    "payload": {
        // to be determined
    },
    "version": "0.1.0"
}
```
